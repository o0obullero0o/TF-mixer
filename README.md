# TF-mixer
TF Editor 
it only be so cool get make daw in yamahaÂ´s TF mixer or from Editor so I look at daw code and where do after 1 hr only say yamaha do not do in 2022 they hivs only in 80 or so if I can do with daw code then manage 1 hour out problems so why not yamaha make it in the Editor or open up so it is an opportunity?

number two things that I can see in the code are
clk_44: Master Clock => INT44.1kHz
clk_48: Master Clock => INT48.0kHz
does not give people the opportunity to choose what then will buy mixer in them have meat mixer of yamaha and for of compared with x32 for about the same price can much more one TF Mixer!
